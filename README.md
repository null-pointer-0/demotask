# demotask
For_Internship_purpose.
Instead of adding Edittext ,I have introduced a seek bar so that you can select the timer value(not more than 30 min).
App has pause,reset and run buttons.
It plays music1 while the timer is running and music2 when timer ends or finishes.
Also I have not overrided the onpause() and onstop() method so that the timer and music can run in the background as well.
